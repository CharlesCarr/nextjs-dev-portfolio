# Software Development Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website to display my software development projects and provide career information.

## Description

I designed and built this mobile friendly, responsive project portfolio with React and Next.js. I used the combination of React and Next.js for enhanced performance with stronger SEO and UX thanks to both server side and dynamic client side rendering. Additionally, I used [Particles.js](https://particles.js.org/) for the animated background design. I designed this website in Figma prior to building and used CSS modules for dedicated component stylesheets.

## Latest Projects

1. 'My Workout App'

I designed and built this responsive workout web app with React. This is V2 of this project as I wanted to create a more custom workout tracker for myself. After creating a profile, users are able to create, save, and edit new workouts to store in the userâ€™s library of workouts. Users can then select a workout for the day to have on hand while at the gym. 

- Designed and built responsive workout tracker web app to solve issue with lack of customization and ease of use with other apps on the market
- Empowered users to create profiles to create, edit, save, and delete individual workouts to store in a library of workouts for easy daily use at the gym
- Applied knowledge of React with hooks and routing while using Firebase for Auth and database. Styled with Material UI components and CSS modules
- Overcame challenges in creating a simple, effective UI/UX to allow for customization (drag and drop) and passing data unilaterally using state and props through multiple components

2. 'StockChartz'

This project allows users to input stock tickers to display animated, responsive stock price chart data. The user can add up to two stock tickers and compare side by side with a biaxial chart. Users can also easily view percentage change performance in a side component. Stock price data is fetched from an external API for current pricing.

- Developed and styled mobile friendly stock chart display web app
- Enabled users to input up to two stock tickers at once to display price data on biaxial chart with added components for percentage return over selected time period to allow for easy comparison
- Demonstrated React skillset and comfortability manipulating fetched data
using Polygon API. Styled with Chakra UI and used Recharts charting library
- Overcame challenges with multiple asynchronous API calls and styling dynamic line components on chart display for ease of use and visibility
- Followed organized workflow by designing first in Figma followed by assigning tasks and features in ClickUp all prior to coding to create a more seamless development process
